# AI Council

An invite-only multi-model council you can self-host. The **source** is [MIT-licensed](LICENSE). A **deployment** stays private: only invited addresses can sign in.

It uses Supabase for authentication and data, OpenRouter's OpenAI-compatible API for LLM calls, and Firecrawl's standalone API for optional web research.

## Features

- Invite-only Supabase auth with admin invites.
- Saved and ephemeral council chats.
- Up to 8 model council members with a separate judge model.
- Optional web research through Firecrawl's standalone search API, with at least 15 detailed sources gathered before council answers.
- File attachments in chat: upload up to 5 private files per run, with text extraction for text-like formats such as Markdown, CSV, JSON, SQL, logs, and source files. Previously uploaded files stay in a composer library so they can be reused, and remaining storage is shown against the per-user quota.
- Usage and cost tracking: every member can see their monthly spend and remaining budget, and admins can inspect a member's usage and set per-user budgets.
- Evals for comparing labeled council configurations with rubric scores and per-prompt detail. Long evals stream progress, can be stopped, keep partial scores after a timeout, and can resume remaining prompts.

## Project structure

- `app/` contains Next.js App Router pages and HTTP route handlers.
- `components/` contains the client-facing council, admin, eval, and authentication interfaces.
- `lib/` contains council orchestration, provider clients, validation, persistence helpers, and shared utilities.
- `supabase/migrations/` contains the database schema, row-level security policies, and private attachment bucket setup.
- `tests/` contains Vitest unit tests and Playwright browser smoke tests.

## Local setup

1. Install Node.js 20.9 or newer. Node.js 22 is the repository default in `.node-version`.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the required keys.
3. Create a Supabase project and run every SQL migration in `supabase/migrations` in filename order.
4. Install dependencies and run the app:

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

If the app opens to `/setup`, one or more required keys are still missing.
After editing `.env.local`, restart `npm run dev`.

## Configuration

| Variable | Requirement | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Required in production | Canonical public origin. Production requires HTTPS. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Required | Supabase project URL used by browser and server clients. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Required | Publishable Supabase key used for user sessions. |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Required | Server-only key used for privileged database operations. Never expose it to the browser. |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Required | Server-only key used for model discovery and council completions. |
| `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` | Optional | Enables web research through Firecrawl's `/v2/search` API. |
| `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL` | One-time setup | Bootstraps the first administrator only while no profiles exist. The first login persists a normal admin invite. |
| `ALLOWED_MODEL_IDS` | Required in production | Comma-separated OpenRouter model allowlist enforced by the server. |
| `DEFAULT_MONTHLY_BUDGET_USD` | Required in production | Hard per-user monthly default when a profile has no custom budget. |
| `MAX_USER_ATTACHMENT_STORAGE_MB` | Optional | Per-user active attachment quota; defaults to 100 MB. |
| `EPHEMERAL_ATTACHMENT_TTL_HOURS` | Optional | Retention for unsaved attachments; defaults to 24 hours. |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Required in production | At least 32 characters; authenticates scheduled maintenance. |
| `ERROR_WEBHOOK_URL` | Optional | HTTPS destination for structured application error events. |
| `REQUIRE_PRODUCTION_ENV` | Self-hosted production | Set to `true` to fail startup when production configuration is invalid. Vercel production is detected automatically. |

File uploads use the private Supabase Storage bucket created by `supabase/migrations/0003_file_attachments.sql`.

## Verification

Run the local quality gate:

```bash
npm run check
```

That command runs ESLint, TypeScript, and the Vitest unit suite. Run the complete release gate and browser checks before deployment:

```bash
npm run check:release
npm run test:e2e
```

Playwright starts the development server automatically and exercises both desktop Chromium and a mobile viewport. The smoke test uses `/setup`, so it does not require live Supabase or provider credentials. Install the Chromium browser once if Playwright requests it:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

`check:release` adds the production build and production dependency audit. GitHub Actions additionally runs the credential-free Playwright suite on desktop and mobile for every push and pull request.

Useful individual commands:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run test:watch
npm run test:e2e
```

## Production deployment

Read [docs/PRODUCTION.md](docs/PRODUCTION.md) before the first deployment. It covers database rollout, secrets, health checks, alerting, smoke tests, rollback, backup/restore, retention, and provider-data considerations.

Security controls and disclosure guidance are documented in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Hosted services

A running instance sends prompts, attachments, and optional research queries to the providers you configure (typically OpenRouter, Supabase, and Firecrawl). This license does not grant access to those services. Use your own accounts and keys, and review their terms before accepting user data.

## License

AI Council is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). `package.json` stays `"private": true` so the app is not published to the npm registry.
